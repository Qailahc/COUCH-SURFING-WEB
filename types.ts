// Price Type
export type Price = 25 | 30 | 35 | 45
// Country Type
export type Country = 'Colombia' | 'Poland' | 'United Kingdom' | 'Malaysia'

// These types are then exported, making them available for use in other parts of the application. 
// By defining these types, the code ensures that only specific values can be assigned to variables of these types, enhancing type safety and reducing potential errors
